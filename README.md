 Introduction to RISC-V

RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) known for its flexibility, modularity, and extensibility. Unlike proprietary architectures, RISC-V provides blueprint access, allowing customization for specific applications. Its adoption spans diverse industries, from embedded systems to high-performance computing and AI, due to cost-effective customization, innovation potential, and robust security. RISC-V is hailed as the future of processing, placing customizable technology in developers' hands.
