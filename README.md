## RTL to GDS: From Code to Silicon

The RTL to GDS flow is a crucial process in the semiconductor industry, transforming a high-level digital design written at the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) into a layout format (GDSII) that can be used for chip manufacturing. This flow ensures that a design, described through hardware description languages like Verilog or VHDL, is accurately converted into a physical layout that meets performance, area, and power requirements. It involves multiple stages of synthesis, verification, and physical design, culminating in generating the GDSII file, which is essential for fabricating integrated circuits.

 # Introduction to RISC-V

RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) known for its flexibility, modularity, and extensibility. Unlike proprietary architectures, RISC-V provides blueprint access, allowing customization for specific applications. Its adoption spans diverse industries, from embedded systems to high-performance computing and AI, due to cost-effective customization, innovation potential, and robust security. RISC-V is hailed as the future of processing, placing customizable technology in developers' hands.

ISA: ISA is known as "Instruction Set Architecture".It is merely a means of interacting with the computer. Generally speaking, we use coding languages like C, Java, and others to write programs that the system must perform, but machines cannot comprehend these languages. Here's when ISA enters the picture. The written codes will be translated from assembly language to binary, or machine-comprehensible language, using ISA. The RISC V ISA is the most recent ISA to be published, and it serves this purpose.

### 1. **Application Software or Apps:**
   - **Examples:** Mozilla Firefox, Acrobat Reader DC, Oracle VM VirtualBox, Microsoft Office (Word, PowerPoint, Excel).
   - These are end-user programs designed for specific tasks like browsing the web, reading PDFs, or creating documents and presentations. They rely on system software to interact with hardware.

### 2. **System Software:**
   - **Operating System (OS):** Windows, macOS, Linux.
   - The OS handles **I/O operations**, **memory allocation**, and **low-level system functions** like managing hardware resources.
   - The OS also runs software like compilers and assemblers to execute programs written in high-level languages (like C, C++, VB, Java).

### 3. **Compiler:**
   - The compiler translates high-level programming languages (C, C++, VB, Java) into machine-level instructions (Instr1, Instr2, ...). This is typically done by converting the code into an intermediate file, such as a **.exe file** in the case of Windows.

### 4. **Assembler:**
   - The assembler converts these instructions into binary machine code, represented as 1s and 0s (e.g., **1010001110101**).
   - This binary code is what the hardware understands and uses to perform operations.

### 5. **Hardware:**
   - The final destination of the translated code is the physical hardware, which may consist of complex structures like chips (represented in the diagram with Dout1, Dout2, etc.).
   - The binary instructions from the software are directly executed by the hardware to carry out the intended tasks, whether itâ€™s computation, I/O operations, or other low-level functions.

The above-shown connections are a netlist with 2 flops and 2 gates.

**netlist**: A "netlist" describes the connectivity of an electronic design.

Consider a netlist that has two logic gates and two flipflops each having an area of 1 sq. unit. The netlist contains 4 elements and the minimum total area required for the core area will be 4 sq. units.

**Utilization Factor**: Utilization Factor is defined as "The ratio of the core area occupied by the netlist to the total core area".For a good FloorPlan, The Utilization Factor should never be '1' because when the Utilization factor becomes '1', there will be no place for adding additional logic if needed and it will be considered as a bad FloorPlan.

**Aspect Ratio**: Aspect Ratio is defined as "The ratio of Height of the core to the width of the core". If the Aspect ratio is '1' , then the core is said to be in a square shape and other than '1' the core will be a rectangle.
 
 
```
 Utilisation Factor =  Area occupied by netlist
                     __________________________
                        Total area of core
```

```
Aspect Ratio =  Height
               ________
                Width
```

Utilisation Factor = 4 sq.units/4 sq.units=1(1 denotes 100% Utilisation)

Aspect Ratio=(2 units)/(2 units)=1.The core is in a square shape

Utilisation Factor = (4 sq.units)/(8 sq.units) = 0.5(denotes 50% Utilisation)

Aspect Ratio=(2 units)/(4 units) = 0.5.The core is in a rectangular shape

# Practical Section-2
  > Invoke Openlane flow and perform synthesis



1. **Change Directory**

  
   ```
   cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane
   ```

2. **Create Docker Alias**

  
   ```
   alias docker='docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e 
   PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) efabless/openlane:v0.21'
   ```

   

3. **Run the Docker Container**

   Once the alias is set, you can start the OpenLANE flow Docker container by  running
   ```
   docker
   ```
4. **Running the OpenLANE Flow Script in Interactive Mode**
   ```
    ./flow.tcl -interactive
   ```
   The command ``./flow.tcl -interactive runs the flow.tcl `` Tcl script in interactive mode. 
   This starts the OpenLANE design flow, allowing you to interact with the tool in real time and 
   issue additional commands as needed.

5. **Loading the OpenLANE Package in Tcl**
   ```
   % package require openlane
   ```
   The command ``% package requires openlane`` to be used in Tcl (Tool Command Language) to 
   load the OpenLANE package.

6. **Preparing the `picorv32a` Design for Processing** 

   ```
   % prep -design picorv32a
   ```
   The command ``% prep -design picorv32a`` initializes and prepares the ``picorv32a`` design in OpenLANE for further processing

7. **Synthesis Process**

   ```
   run_synthesis
   ```

8. **To run the picorv32a floorplan in openLANE**

   ```
   run_floorplan
   ```

### Die Area Calculation

#### Values:
- **Die width in unit distance**= `660685-0`
- **Die height in unit distance**= `671405-0`

#### Conversion to microns:
Since **1000 unit distance = 1 micron**:

1. **Die width in microns**:
   ```
   660685 / 1000 = 660.685 microns
   ```

2. **Die height in microns**:
   ```
   671405 / 1000 = 671.405 microns
   ```

#### Area of the die in square microns:
     
    
    Area = 660.685 microns * 671.405 microns = 443587.212425 square microns
    
    

 
 . The **area of the die** is approximately **443587.21 square microns**.

> The 16-mask CMOS process consists of the following steps:

1. Selection of substrate: Secting the body/substrate material.
2. Creating active region for transistors: Isolation between active region pockets by SiO2 and Si3N4 deposition followed by photolithography and etching.
3. N-well and P-well formation: Ion implantation by Boron for P-well and by Phosphorous for N-well formation.
4. Formation of gate terminal: NMOS and PMOS gates formed by photolithography techniques.
5. LDD (lightly doped drain) formation: LDD formed to prevent the hot electron effect.
6. Source & drain formation: Screen oxide was added to avoid channeling during implants followed by Arsenic implantation and annealing.
7. Local interconnect formation: Removal of screen oxide by HF etchingâ€”deposition of Ti for low-resistant contacts.
8. Higher level metal formation: CMP for planarization followed by TiN and Tungsten deposition. Top SiN layer for chip protection.

### Rise Transition Time Calculation

We calculate the rise transition time as follows:

```
Rise transition time = 2.20029 -2.17992= 0.02037 ns
```

Which can be converted to picoseconds (ps):

```
 0.02037 ns = 20.37 ps
```

Thus, the rise transition time is **20.37 ps**.

### Fall Transition Time Calculation

We calculate the rise transition time as follows:

```
Fall transition time = 4.06673-4.04015 = 0.02658 ns
```

Which can be converted to picoseconds (ps):

```
0.02658 ns = 26.58 ps
```

Thus, the Fall transition time is **29.99 ps**.

**Rise Cell Delay**
```
Rise Cell Delay= 2.1808-2.18092=-0.00012 ns
```
Which can be converted to picoseconds (ps):
```
-0.00012 ns=-00.12 ps
```
Thus, the Rise cell delay is **-00.12 ps**

**Fall Cell Delay**
```
Fall Cell Delay= 4.05343-4.05354=-0.00011 ns
```
Which can be converted to picoseconds (ps):
```
-0.00011 ns =-00.11 ps
```
Thus, the Fall cell delay is **-00.11 ps**

 # Day Four
 

 
  A requirement for ports as specified in tracks.info is that they should be at the intersection of horizontal and vertical tracks. The CMOS Inverter ports A and Y are on the li1 layer. It must be ensured that they're on the intersection of horizontal and vertical tracks. We access the tracks.info 
  


1. **Change Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/vsdstdcelldesign
   ```
 

2. **Open Custom Inverter Layout in Magic:**
   ```bash
   magic -T sky130A.tech sky130_inv.mag &
   ```
   


![Screenshot 2024-09-14 152906](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d739ad4-8755-48f6-815a-f68274db45a9)

  
  


  To ensure that ports lie on the intersection point, the grid spacing in Magic (tkcon) must be changed to the li1 X and li1 Y values. Convergence of grid and tracks can be achieved using the following command:
  
 To set the grid values in Magic, you can use the `grid` command. :

1. **Get Syntax for Grid Command:**
   ```bash
   help grid
   ```
   This command will show you the syntax and options available for the `grid` command in Magic.

2. **Set Grid Values:**
   ```bash
   grid 0.46um 0.34um 0.23um 0.17um
   ```
   This command sets the grid values as follows:
   - **0.46um**: X-grid spacing (main grid)
   - **0.34um**: Y-grid spacing (main grid)
   - **0.23um**: X-grid spacing (minor grid)
   - **0.17um**: Y-grid spacing (minor grid)

**Height of standard cell = 2.72 Âµm = 0.34 Âµm Ã— 8**

To save and open a layout with custom names in Magic, you would use the following commands:

### Saving the Layout
To save the current layout with a custom name, use the `save` command in the Tkcon window:

```tcl
save sky130_vsdinv.mag
```

This command will save the currently open layout as `sky130_vsdinv.mag`.

### Opening the Layout
To open the newly saved layout in Magic, use the `magic` command in your terminal:

```bash
magic -T sky130A.tech sky130_vsdinv.mag &
```

Here's a brief explanation:
- `-T sky130A.tech`: Specifies the technology file to use.
- `sky130_vsdinv.mag`: The name of the layout file you want to open.
- `&`: Runs the command in the background, allowing you to continue using the terminal.

**Copying Custom LEF and Required LIB Files to `picorv32a` Design's src Directory**

### Copying the LEF File:
```bash
# Copy the custom LEF file to the src directory of picorv32a
cp sky130_vsdinv.lef ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/src/
```

### Verifying LEF File Copy:
```bash
# List files in the src directory to confirm the LEF file is copied
ls ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/src/
```

### Copying the Required LIB Files:
```bash
# Copy the required LIB files to the src directory of picorv32a
cp libs/sky130_fd_sc_hd__* ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/src/
```

### Verifying LIB Files Copy:
```bash
# List files in the src directory to confirm the LIB files are copied
ls ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/src/
```
![Screenshot 2024-09-14 193544](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34ad96e3-5ce2-463f-bdc9-3b15e06aeb4a)

 **Edit 'config.tcl' to change lib file and add the new extra lef into the openlane flow.**

### 1. **Setting the LIB Files:**
```tcl
# Set the path for the synthesized library (LIB_SYNTH)
set ::env(LIB_SYNTH) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__typical.lib"

# Set the path for the fastest library (LIB_FASTEST)
set ::env(LIB_FASTEST) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__fast.lib"

# Set the path for the slowest library (LIB_SLOWEST)
set ::env(LIB_SLOWEST) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__slow.lib"

# Set the path for the typical library (LIB_TYPICAL)
set ::env(LIB_TYPICAL) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/src/sky130_fd_sc_hd__typical.lib"
```

### 2. **Adding the Custom LEF File:**
```tcl
# Add extra LEF files, including the custom LEF
set ::env(EXTRA_LEFS) [glob $::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/$::env(DESIGN_NAME)/src/*.lef]
```

### Final Steps:
1. Save the `config.tcl` file with these changes.
2. When you run the OpenLane flow, it will automatically use the modified library paths and include your custom cell's LEF file.

### Clock Tree Synthesis

### Steps:

1. **Navigate to the OpenLane Directory:**

 
   
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane
   ```

2. **Run OpenSTA with the `pre_sta.conf` Script:**



1. **Re-prep the design to update variables**:
   This command preps the design again with a specific tag (`09-09_06-53`) and overwrites the existing files:
   ```tcl
   prep -design picorv32a -tag 09-09_06-53 -overwrite
   ```

2. **Include newly added LEF files**:
   After prepping, include the updated LEF files (if any) into the OpenLANE flow:
   ```tcl
   set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
   add_lefs -src $lefs
   ```

3. **Set new values for synthesis strategy and sizing**:
   Set a new synthesis strategy (e.g., prioritize delay with a factor of 3):
     ```tcl
     set ::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY) "DELAY 3"
     ```
    Set the synthesis sizing:
     ```tcl
     set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1
     ```

4. **Run synthesis**:
   After prepping and updating variables, rerun the synthesis:
   ```tcl
   run_synthesis
   ```

5. **Run floorplanning steps (init floorplan, place I/O, tap, decap)**:
   The following commands are internally sourced when you run the `run_floorplan` command:
   ```tcl
   init_floorplan
   place_io
   tap_decap_or
   ```

6. **Run placement**:
   After floorplanning, you can proceed with the placement:
   ```tcl
   run_placement
   ```

7. **Unset `LIB_CTS` environment variable if there is an error**:
   In case you encounter an error related to clock tree synthesis (CTS), you can unset the `LIB_CTS` variable:
   ```tcl
   unset ::env(LIB_CTS)
   ```

8. **Run clock tree synthesis (CTS)**:
   Finally, after placement, proceed to run CTS:
   ```tcl
   run_cts
   ```

### DAY FIVE

**Theory**

Hereâ€™s a suitable header for your commands to generate the Power Distribution Network (PDN) and explore the PDN layout using OpenLANE:

---

# Power Distribution Network (PDN) Generation and Layout Exploration in OpenLANE


###  **Navigate to the OpenLane Flow Directory**:
   
   
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane
   ```

### **Run the Docker Command**:
   Since we have aliased the Docker command with the environment setup, we can simply run the following:

   ```bash
   docker
   ```





###  Enter OpenLANE Flow Interactive Mode
```bash
./flow.tcl -interactive
```


---

### Load Required OpenLANE Package
```bash
package require openlane 0.9
```


---

###  Prepare the Design
```bash
prep -design picorv32a
```

---

### Add New LEF Files
```bash
set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs
```

---

### : Set Synthesis Strategy
```bash
set ::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY) "DELAY 3"
```


---

###  Set Synthesis Sizing
```bash
set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1
```


---

###  Run Synthesis
```bash
run_synthesis
```

---

### Initialize Floorplan
```bash
init_floorplan
```


---

###  Place I/O Pads
```bash
place_io
```


---

###  Insert Decap and Tap Cells
```bash
tap_decap_or
```


---

### Run Placement
```bash
run_placement
```


---

### : Handle CTS Library Issue (Optional)

```bash
unset ::env(LIB_CTS)
```


---

###  Run Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)

### Commands to load PDN def in magic in another terminal

### Change Directory to the PDN DEF File Location
```bash
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/09-09_06-53/tmp/floorplan/
```
This command navigates to the directory where the PDN DEF (Design Exchange Format) file is located, so you can load it in the Magic tool.

---

###  Load PDN DEF File into Magic Tool
```bash
magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read 18-pdn.def &
