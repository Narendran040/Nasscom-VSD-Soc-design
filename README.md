## RTL to GDS: From Code to Silicon

The RTL to GDS flow is a crucial process in the semiconductor industry, transforming a high-level digital design written at the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) into a layout format (GDSII) that can be used for chip manufacturing. This flow ensures that a design, described through hardware description languages like Verilog or VHDL, is accurately converted into a physical layout that meets performance, area, and power requirements. It involves multiple stages of synthesis, verification, and physical design, culminating in generating the GDSII file, which is essential for fabricating integrated circuits.

>Package: QFN 48

QFN: Stands for Quad Flat No-Lead. This is a type of surface-mount package where the leads (or pins) are located underneath the package rather than around the sides. This design allows for a smaller footprint and often better thermal performance compared to other package types.

48: This indicates the number of pins or contacts on the package.

 Introduction to RISC-V

RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) known for its flexibility, modularity, and extensibility. Unlike proprietary architectures, RISC-V provides blueprint access, allowing customization for specific applications. Its adoption spans diverse industries, from embedded systems to high-performance computing and AI, due to cost-effective customization, innovation potential, and robust security. RISC-V is hailed as the future of processing, placing customizable technology in developers' hands.

# Standard Cell Design Flow
1. Inputs: PDKs, DRC & LVS rules, SPICE models, libraries, and user-defined specifications.
2. Design steps: Circuit design, Layout design (Art of layout Euler's path and stick diagram), Extraction of parasitics, Characterization (timing, noise, power).
3. Outputs: CDL (circuit description language), LEF, GDSII, extracted SPICE netlist (.cir), timing, noise, and power .lib files

# Timing Parameter Definitions

|Timing defintion|	Value|
|----------------|------|
|slew_low_rise_thr	|20% value|
|slew_high_rise_thr	|80% value|
|slew_low_fall_thr	|20% value|
|slew_high_fall_thr	|80% value|
|in_rise_thr	 |50% value|
|in_fall_thr	 |50% value|

```
rise delay =  time(out_fall_thr) - time(in_rise_thr)

Fall transition time: time(slew_high_fall_thr) - time(slew_low_fall_thr)

Rise transition time: time(slew_high_rise_thr) - time(slew_low_rise_thr)

  # 16 Mask CMOS Fabrication

> The 16-mask CMOS process consists of the following steps:

1. Selection of substrate: Secting the body/substrate material.
2. Creating active region for transistors: Isolation between active region pockets by SiO2 and Si3N4 deposition followed by photolithography and etching.
3. N-well and P-well formation: Ion implantation by Boron for P-well and by Phosphorous for N-well formation.
4. Formation of gate terminal: NMOS and PMOS gates formed by photolithography techniques.
5. LDD (lightly doped drain) formation: LDD formed to prevent the hot electron effect.
6. Source & drain formation: Screen oxide was added to avoid channeling during implants followed by Arsenic implantation and annealing.
7. Local interconnect formation: Removal of screen oxide by HF etchingâ€”deposition of Ti for low-resistant contacts.
8. Higher level metal formation: CMP for planarization followed by TiN and Tungsten deposition. Top SiN layer for chip protection.

 # Day Four
 

 
  A requirement for ports as specified in tracks.info is that they should be at the intersection of horizontal and vertical tracks. The CMOS Inverter ports A and Y are on the li1 layer. It needs to be ensured that they're on the intersection of horizontal and vertical tracks. We access the tracks.info 
  
  ```
  vim tracks.info
  ```

  ![vim](https://github.com/Narendran040/Nasscom-VSD-Soc-design/assets/157210399/42420742-084e-4fc6-921f-e8eed7e5b8aa)

  > Grid spacing using Magic


  To ensure that ports lie on the intersection point, the grid spacing in Magic (tkcon) must be changed to the li1 X and li1 Y values. Convergence of grid and tracks can be achieved using the following command:
  
  ```
  grid 0.46um 0.34um 0.23um 0.17um
  ```
